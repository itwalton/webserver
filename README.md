# Mathserver

A simple server that receives a number from the client and returns the squared result.

Just a fun little re-implementation of a socket programming project from a college course years ago.

## Installation
### With XCode Compiler
1. Compile server `gcc -o server server.c`
2. Run server `./server [port]
3. Compile client `gcc -o client client.c`
4. Run client `./client [serv_address] [serv_port]`
